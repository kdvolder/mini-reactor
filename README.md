Mini-Reactor
============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kdvolder/mini-reactor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kdvolder/mini-reactor)

This is a 'toy' implementation of [reactive streams][1] inspired by [Reactor][2].

It implements a very tiny subset of what reactor implements. It strives for the 
most straigtforward and easy to understand implementation possible (whereas
reactor's code is quite complex and highly optimized).

Its main purpose is for the author (me) to learn about reactive streams. 
I've always found that implementing something is one of the best ways
to really understand it.

What this is not
----------------

 - a 'real' implementation that you want to use in production
 - thoroughly tested and bug-free
